## How to use

Download the latest ZIP from the releases

In the dropdown, select the relevant WoW.exe process. Once selected, check the screenshot to ensure it's the correct WoW screen. Then, click 'Start Watching'

This is designed to be run when you're not at your computer - it'll constantly make the WoW process the active screen and will be pretty annoying to use alongside anything else

Works best when you have WoW maximised
